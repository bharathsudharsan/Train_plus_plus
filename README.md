# Train++: An incremental training algorithm to enable binary classifier training on MCUs

**Overview:** We provide *Train++* algorithm for all Arduino IDE supported MCUs. Train++ is our incremental training algorithm that can be used to train binary classifiers on MCUs using large volume, high dimensional, real-time data, thus producing self-learning IoT edge devices capable of learning to perform analytics for any target IoT use cases.
