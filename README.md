# Train++: An incremental training algorithm to enable binary classifier training on MCUs

**Overview:** We provide Train++, an incremental binary classifier training algorithm for MCUs. Train++ can be used to train binary classifiers on MCUs using large volume, high dimensional, real-time data, thus producing self-learning devices capable of learning to perform analytics for any target IoT use cases.
